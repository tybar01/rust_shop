# # Overview

In this Project I wnted to tinker around with rust and start to bring in higher level 
concepts like structures and object oritented programming that I'm experienced with
from other languages. I also wanted to understand a little about the special memory
managment that rust uses.

The program that I wrote is for finding what shops are open based on the time 
that is given. It can compare the time given to the shop open and close time
and tell the user what shops will be open during that time. 


This software was meant to be a simple framework for how to compare against
larger amounts of data using loops and structs with implimentations. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment


For Rust I used visual studio code as well as the rust-analyzer
extension for giving more information inside the environment.
I also used cargo for managing the project for if I was going 
to add more files in the future to this. 

Rust is a language that behaves very similarly to C++ in its 
basic syntax. The language uses semicolons and does not seem to care 
about indentation. Rust specializes in memory managment and does
more checks during compile time to make sure that the memory is being
used safely and correctly. This also leads to interesting variable 
ownership that i have not seen as fleshed out in other languages.

# Future Work

- Letting the User enter different times without restarting the program
- Once the user has entered time, let the user look at shop info
- Create functions for shops and allow the functions to hangle variable size
